# Acceptance Criteria

## Original Prompt

Help the team to refine the acceptance criteria. Rewrite what you need and add any additional criteria you consider. Raise questions if you need further definition from the Product Owner.

## Original Acceptance Criteria

1. Given I am in the product list for the first time  
   Then the page is sorted by position

2. Given I am in the product list  
   When I click with my mouse the “Sort By” dropdown control  
   Then I can see four options:  
   - Position  
   - Product Name  
   - Price  
   - New Arrivals

3. Given I am in the product list  
   And I click on the ↑ arrow icon  
   Then the list is sorted in descending order, otherwise in ascending order

## Refined Acceptance Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria 1 — Initial Sort State

**Original:**  
Given I am in the product list for the first time  
Then the page is sorted by position

**Refined:**  
- Given I visit the product listing page for the first time  
- Then the product list should be sorted using a Default sort value  
- And this default value should be internally mapped to item ID or creation timestamp to ensure consistent ordering

**Clarifications and Questions:**  
- The original term “Position” is ambiguous. Does it refer to:
  - A backend-defined merchandising rank?
  - An internal index, ID, or timestamp?
  - A business-defined ordering relevant to specific campaigns?
- Should the default sort persist across sessions or be reset each time the page is loaded?
- Should “Default” be a visible label to end users or only a development/configuration term?

---

### Acceptance Criteria 2 — Sort Options List

**Original:**  
When I click the "Sort By" dropdown, I see four options: Position, Product Name, Price, New Arrivals

**Refined:**  
- Given I open the “Sort By” dropdown menu  
- Then I should see the following five options, in this order:
  1. Default  
  2. Product Name  
  3. Price  
  4. New Arrivals  
  5. [Reserved for future additions if needed]

- And selecting “Default” should reset the list to its initial sort configuration

**Clarifications and Questions:**  
- Is “Default” a user-facing term, or should it be translated into something more meaningful (e.g., “Recommended”)?
- Are the option labels translatable or dynamic?
- Should the dropdown retain the last selected option upon page reload or navigation?
- Will different categories or product groups present different sort options?

---

### Acceptance Criteria 3 — Sort Direction Toggle

**Original:**  
Given I am in the product list  
And I click on the ↑ arrow icon  
Then the list is sorted in descending order, otherwise in ascending order

**Refined:**  
- Given I have selected a sort option  
- When I click the sort direction toggle icon  
- Then the product list should switch between ascending and descending order

**Clarifications and Questions:**  
- Does the icon visibly reflect the current sort direction (e.g., flipping orientation or styling)?
- Does the sort direction toggle affect the Default sort, or is it disabled for that option?
- Should sort direction be preserved across page reloads, or reset to ascending by default?

---

## Additional Considerations

- Should the current sort type and direction be reflected in the URL (e.g., `?sort=name&dir=desc`)?
- Is there a requirement to preserve sort state when filters or search terms are applied?
- Are accessibility requirements being tracked (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)?
- What behavior is expected for items with identical values under the same sort type?
- Should sort changes trigger analytics or tracking events?
- Will sorting be entirely client-side, or are server-side responses expected per sort criteria?

---

## Provisional Acceptance Criteria (Under Investigation)

The following criteria are exploratory and not yet confirmed as part of the accepted scope. They raise potentially useful capabilities and edge cases for further discussion with the team and Product Owner.

---

### Provisional AC 1 — Role-Based Behavior

- The sort controls and options are available to all users, regardless of authentication status.
- No sort behavior changes based on user role, locale, or permissions.

**Open Questions:**  
- Are any product segments or sort types gated by user permissions?
- Should authenticated users have persistent sort preferences across sessions?

---

### Provisional AC 2 — Data State and Volume

- The sort component handles product lists with over 100 items without noticeable degradation in responsiveness.
- Sort behavior must remain consistent across paginated and non-paginated product views.

**Open Questions:**  
- Will sort be handled client-side, server-side, or hybrid?
- Should sorting apply to all matching results or only the current page?

---

### Provisional AC 3 — Accessibility

- Sort controls are fully operable via keyboard navigation
- Sort state is programmatically accessible to screen readers
- The dropdown and toggle follow ARIA best practices and include visible focus states

**Open Questions:**  
- Are WCAG compliance targets formally defined?
- Have NVDA and VoiceOver behavior been tested?

---

### Provisional AC 4 — Sort State in URL

- The active sort type and direction are reflected in the browser’s URL
- Refreshing or sharing the page preserves the selected sort state

**Open Questions:**  
- Is this pattern used in other filter components across the site?
- Are there SEO or analytics implications for deep linking?
